I have built a **Portfolio Website** to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in **Web Development** and **UI/UX Design**. It highlights my journey, including my **internships at Smartknower, Codsoft, and Nexus Info**, where I gained hands-on experience in building responsive websites. The site features a clean and interactive design, demonstrating my expertise in **frontend and backend technologies**. Visitors can explore my projects, read about my skills, and connect with me easily. My goal is to use this platform to share my work and grow as a **Full Stack Developer**. ðŸš€
